FLAVIUS 

Hence! Home, you idle {PLURAL_ANIMAL_1}, get you home!
Is this a {PLACE_1}? What, know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not {VERB_1}
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession?—Speak, what trade art thou?

CARPENTER  

Why, sir, a {OCCUPATION_1}.

MARULLUS 

Where is thy leather {PLURAL_CLOTHING_ITEM_1} and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?—
You, sir, what trade are you?

COBBLER  

Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
but, as you would say, a {OCCUPATION_2}.

MARULLUS 

But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.

COBBLER  

A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe
conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad
{NOUN_1}.

FLAVIUS 

What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what
trade?

COBBLER 

Nay, I {ACTION_1} you, sir, be not out with me.
Yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

MARULLUS 

What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou {ADJECTIVE_1}
fellow?

COBBLER  

Why, sir, cobble you.

FLAVIUS  

Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

COBBLER  

Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the
awl. I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor
women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a
surgeon to old {OBJECT_1}: when they are in great danger,
I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.

FLAVIUS 

But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

COBBLER  

Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to
get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we
make holiday to see {FUNNY_NAME_1} and to rejoice in his
triumph.
