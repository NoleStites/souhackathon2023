Act II, Scene II

JULIET

What man art thou that thus {VERB_1}'d in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO

By a {NOUN_1}
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My {SAME_NOUN_1}, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the {OBJECT_1}.

JULIET

My ears have not yet {VERB_PAST_TENSE_1} a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the {NOUN_2}:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO

Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The {LOCATION_1} walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my {PLURAL_ANIMAL_1} find thee here.

ROMEO

With love's {ADJECTIVE_1} wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold {PLURAL_NOUN_1} out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy {PLURAL_ANIMAL_2} are no let to me.

JULIET

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twelve of their {PLURAL_WEAPON_1}: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET

I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO

I have night's {CLOTHING_ITEM_1} to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
