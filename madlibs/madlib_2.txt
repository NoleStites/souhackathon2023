ANTONIO 

In sooth I know not why I am so {EMOTION_1}.
It wearies me, you say it wearies you.
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn.
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
That I have much ado to {VERB_1} myself.

SALARINO 

Your {OBJECT_1} is tossing on the ocean,
There where your argosies with portly sail
(Like signiors and rich {PLURAL_OCCUPATION_1} on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea)
Do {VERB_2} the petty traffickers
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
As they fly by them with their woven {OBJECT_2}.

SOLANIO 

Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my {NOUN_1} would
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
stomping the grass to know where sits the {NOUN_2},
Piring in maps for ports and piers and {NOUN_3};
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
Would make me {EMOTION_2}.

SALARINO  

My wind cooling my {FOOD_1}
Would blow me to an ague when I thought
What harm a {NOUN_4} too great might do at sea.
I should not see the sandy {OBJECT_3} run
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy {NAME_1} docked in sand,
Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial. Should I go to {LOCATION_1}
And see the holy edifice of stone
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,
Would scatter all her {FOOD_2} on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my {PLURAL_OBJECT_4},
And, in a word, but even now worth this
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me: I know {NAME_2}
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
