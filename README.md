# Shakespearean MadLib

Southern Oregon University Hackathon 2023 project by Nole Stites

### Description of Project

My Hackathon project is a take on the classic game MadLibs. MadLibs, for those who do not know, is a game where an often humorous story is created by the player filling in certain blanks within the text.

This project lets the user play a game of MadLibs themed after their choice of Shakespeare's plays.

I am using a Python-based Flask application to allow the user to interact with my program through a webpage as opposed to a terminal.

### Setup Instructions
NOTE: The below instructions assume that you have a terminal that can run Linux commands successfully.

* Open a Linux terminal of your choice and clone the project using the following command:
* * $ git clone https://github.com/NoleStites/souhackathon2023.git
