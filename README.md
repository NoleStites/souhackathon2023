# Shakespearean MadLib

Southern Oregon University Hackathon 2023 project by Nole Stites

### Description of Project

My Hackathon project is a take on the classic game MadLibs. MadLibs, for those who do not know, is a game where an often humorous story is created by the player filling in certain blanks within the text.

This project lets the user play a game of MadLibs themed after their choice of Shakespeare's plays.

### Setup Instructions
